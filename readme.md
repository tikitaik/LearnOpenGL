Hello!

This is the repo of my LearnOpenGL experience.

You should (hopefully) be able to pull and run make if you have windows/mac/linux and OpenGL dependencies installed (maybe GLFW too I'm not 100% sure).

This commit is the end of the PBR pages so it is a little sphere demo but you should be able to pull most commits and see what has changed along the way :)
